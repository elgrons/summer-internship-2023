## Description <a id="description"></a> 

(Name Pending) is a web application built with React and Typescript while using (Tech stack pending for database, backend API's etc)... The app aims to allow partners to visualize scrum point systems in order to understand progress made by developers on their projects.

Furthermore, this project looks to add real-time communication libraries to enable users and admins to work at the same time as well as authorization for admins to only see projects that are they are assocaited with.
